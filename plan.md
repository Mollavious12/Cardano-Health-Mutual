## Notes
- **Authentication**: Using Clerk (reflex-clerk-api) for authentication with environment variables:
  - CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  - CLERK_SECRET_KEY
- MongoDB available for additional data storage if needed
- Focus on mobile-first responsive design
- Purple/gray color scheme matching CareChain branding
- Prioritize accessibility and clarity for low-literacy users
- **Important**: Clerk authentication does NOT work in iframes (security policy) - test in new tab when deployed
